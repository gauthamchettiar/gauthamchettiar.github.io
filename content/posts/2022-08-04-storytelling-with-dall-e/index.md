I recently got access to {{<newtabref title="DALL·E 2" href="https://openai.com/dall-e-2/">}}. 

I was super excited, like a little kid getting a new toy. Though DALL·E *(here on, I will be referring to "DALL·E 2", simply as "DALL·E")* is not a toy by any standards, yet it gave me immense pleasure while waiting for it to render an output for my prompt.

For those unaware of what DALL·E is - It can generate realistic images from your text prompts. 

Not impressed? Here are some examples -

**Prompt:** *monkey astronaut showing five fingers, digital art* <br>
> ![DALL·E Illustration : monkey astronaut showing five fingers, digital art](images/DALL·E-monkey_astronaut_showing_five_fingers_%2C_digital_art.png)

**Prompt:** *a cat enjoying a cup of tea, gothic* <br>
> ![DALL·E Illustration : a cat enjoying a cup of tea, gothic](images/DALL%C2%B7E-a_cat_enjoying_a_cup_of_tea_%2C_gothic.png)

**Prompt:** *man fixing a computer, medieval painting* <br>
> ![DALL·E Illustration : man fixing a computer, medieval painting](images/DALL%C2%B7E-man_fixing_a_computer_%2C_medieval_painting.png)

**Prompt:** *dinosaur plucking flowers from garden, realistic* <br>
> ![DALL·E Illustration : dinosaur plucking flowers from garden, realistic](images/DALL%C2%B7E-dinosaur_plucking_flowers_from_garden_%2C_realistic.png)

Impressive right? There's a lot more of such examples here - {{<newtabref title="DALL·E 2" href="https://openai.com/dall-e-2/">}}.

After trying out hundreds of prompts, I got a fair bit of understanding of the possibilities and limits. Which has already been extensively documented, so I won't be going into that.

What I am trying now is how convincing would it be to illustrate a really simple children's story with DALL·E and get away with it. 

Why children's story you ask? Because they are much simpler and has a higher chance of DALL·E yielding a convincing image. 

In order to keep it interesting and highly absurd, I wrote a small story myself. 

So, here we go -

## Adventure of Muffin

### Muffin - The Munchkin 
---

**In dense forest of Amazon lived 'Muffin' - A cheerful little monkey. Who zoomed from tree-to-tree playing with his friends.**

**Muffin lived with his Mom, Grandpa and 2 brothers. Mom and Grandpa would bring in food from far away trees.**

**Muffin loved Banana. Every time Mom got home with Banana, Muffin would jump past his siblings and swiftly take the bunch away.**

*Prompt: happy little monkey running towards camera with a lots of banana, digital art*

<br>


**Muffin used to get scolded by Mom for this. "*You must share with everyone equally!*" - Mom used to say.**

**Secretly, Mom was amazed by Muffin's ability. He was indeed gifted with a super-power, he could jump the highest among any monkey his age.**

**Muffin was Mom's favorite little kid.**

<br>

*Prompt: little red happy monkey jumping above trees, with cloud in background, digital art* -->

**Muffin also loved playing tag with his friends. Muffin would jump onto the highest tree or run away faster than anyone could catch him.**

**On one such night, when he was hiding on top of a tree. He saw a banana in the sky.**

**It was not just any Banana, it was a glowing Banana!**

<br>

*Prompt: little monkey seeing a glowing banana in sky, digital art*

<br>

**All this playing had made Muffin hungry. He wanted to eat that Banana**

**He jumped up and tried to catch it, but he could not get it. He tried again with all his might, but he still could not reach it.**

**"*Muffin! get back here. It's getting late!*" - he heard someone calling. He recognized the voice, it was Mom. Muffin walked home without his banana.**

<br>

<!-- ![DALL·E Illustration : ]()
*Prompt: *

<br> -->

**Next morning, Muffin told his friends about the glowing Banana. They decided to search for it today.**

**They searched in East, They Searched in West. They searched in North, they searched in South. They searched everywhere**

**But, No one could find it. Everyone thought Muffin was lying.**

**Muffin got sad.**

<br>

<br>

**Seeing Muffin sad, Grandpa asked - "*What happened to you, Muff-kin? You look sad.*".**

**Muffin told Grandpa about the glowing Banana. Grandpa understood what was going on.**

**With a smile, Grandpa said - "*If you believe and work hard enough towards your goal, you will get what you want!*"**

**Muffin didn't understand it completely. But he was happy that Grandpa believed in him. He happily swinged back home.**

### Muffin's Detour

---

**Few years passed, Muffin had grown into a handsome teen.**

**Muffin had learned to search, hunt and gather food. He would compete with his friends as to who will collect the most amount of fruits each day.**

**Muffin was just as agile as before, he would always be the first to return from search. And would always carry enough food that his entire family can have.**

**He would occasionally search for the golden Banana he saw as a kid. But he could not find it anywhere. And as days went by, he had forgotten about it all together.**

<br>

![DALL·E Illustration : handsome monkey hanging from a tree with a bag full of fruits, digital art](images/DALL%C2%B7E-handsome_monkey_hanging_from_a_tree_with_a_bag_full_of_fruits_%2C_digital_art.png)
*Prompt: handsome monkey hanging from a tree with a bag full of fruits, digital art*

<br>

**Muffin, would go far and deep into forest in search of quality fruits and nuts.**

**On one such occasion, when he had strayed a bit too far from his home. He saw something behind a bunch of trees.**

**Curious, He went towards it. And, as he got closer, he could see a huge wall before him. He had never seen something so huge before in his life.**

**He tried to push it, but it won't budge an inch. He climbed over it, but it still didn't move a bit.**

<br>

![DALL·E Illustration : handsome red monkey inspecting a huge white wall in forest, digital art](images/DALL%C2%B7E-handsome_red_monkey_inspecting_a_huge_white_wall_in_forest_%2C_digital_art.png)
*Prompt: handsome red monkey inspecting a huge white wall in forest, digital art*

<br>

**He looked over the other side. He could see a lot of buildings. Also, there were humans all over the place. He had only heard about Humans from his Grandpa.**

**Grandpa had always warned him about Humans - "Some Humans are harmless, but some are hostile, so you must stay away from them."**

**Muffin decided to go back home. Just as he turned around to leave, he heard a loud sound and suddenly he was covered in something.**

**It was a net, he had once seen a bear stuck in it!**

**He struggled in it, tried to break out of it! He tried to bite it, scratch it and pull it - but nothing worked.**

**After some time Muffin fainted...**

<br>

![DALL·E Illustration : handsome red monkey trapped in a net, trying to escape, digital art](images/DALL%C2%B7E-handsome_red_monkey_trapped_in_a_net_%2C_trying_to_escape_%2C_digital_art.png)
*Prompt: handsome red monkey trapped in a net, trying to escape, digital art*

<br>

**When Muffin woke up. He was inside a large cage.**

**He could see several other monkeys inside. Some were taking a nap, some were eating, some were climbing and some were even curiously looking at him.**

**Muffin was confused and scared. He didn't knew where he was or what was happening to him.**

**He tried to ask other Monkeys but they were just as clueless as he was.**

<br>

![DALL·E Illustration : a lab with multiple monkeys in cage, digital art](images/DALL%C2%B7E-a_lab_with_multiple_monkeys_in_cage_%2C_digital_art.png)
*Prompt: a lab with multiple monkeys in cage, digital art*

<br>

**Muffin looked around him.**

**There were dozens of monkeys all over the place. All monkeys were very calm. Which was very strange to him, since, every other monkey he had seen were very active and playful.**

**In a distance he could see humans with gas mask writing something on their pad. He could also see very strange apparatus with different coloured liquid all over the place.**

**Then he saw those humans press some buttons and smoke filled the room. Monkeys around him slowly lied down and slept.**

**Muffin too felt very sleepy, after struggling to be awake for a few minutes. He slept.**

<br>

![DALL·E Illustration : an illustration of humans with gas mask inside a lab, taking notes, digital art](images/DALL%C2%B7E-an_illustration_of_humans_with_gas_mask_inside_a_lab_%2C_taking_notes_%2C_digital_art.png)
*Prompt: an illustration of humans with gas mask inside a lab, taking notes, digital art*

<br>

**This time, when Muffin woke up he saw a black monkey in front of him. It was a female. Also she was wearing glasses like humans would.**

**She was holding a book. Not just holding, it seemed like she was reading that book.**

**Muffin was confused again, he had never seen a Monkey read a book.**

**She neared Muffin and introduced herself as April.**

<br>

![DALL·E Illustration : handsome black monkey with glasses reading a book, digital art](images/DALL%C2%B7E-handsome_black_monkey_with_glasses_reading_a_book_%2C_digital_art.png)
*Prompt: handsome black monkey with glasses reading a book, digital art*

<br>

**April was born in that lab. She had never seen her mom.**

**Humans gave her food, care and a place to stay. They would give her medicines when she was sick. And tend to her wounds if she had hurt herself.**

**In return, she would be put through various experiments.**

**Some Good, Some Bad!**

**All those experiments over the year, had given her intelligence comparable to Humans. She could not only read a book, but has already read most of published english literature. She can solve most of the puzzles. She can beat a human in a game of chess.**

**She even scored a perfect 120 in IQ, which most humans can't. Among all monkeys, she was the most favorite to humans.**

<br>

![DALL·E Illustration : black and white illustration of a baby black monkey held by people in lab coat, digital art](images/DALL%C2%B7E-black_and_white_illustration_of_a_baby_black_monkey_held_by_people_in_lab_coat_%2C_digital_art.png)
*Prompt: black and white illustration of a baby black monkey held by people in lab coat, digital art*

<br>

**April got everything she asked for - All the food she wanted was prepared for her. All the books she wanted to read were purchased for her. All the skills she wanted to learn was taught to her.**

**Her room was the comfiest of all. She had the best bed money can afford, her room temperature can be adjusted to a point. She had all the luxury that a monkey could only think off.**

**April didn't stay with other monkeys inside a cage. She lived with humans, she interacted with them like any other human would do.**

**Yet... She was missing something, something that humans could never provide her.**

**Love of her family! A life living with one of your own!**

<br>

![DALL·E Illustration : black monkey with glasses looking outside a window, digital art](images/DALL%C2%B7E-black_monkey_with_glasses_looking_outside_a%20window_%2C_digital_art.png)
*Prompt: black monkey with glasses looking outside a window, digital art*

<br>

**Everything started making sense for Muffin.**

**This is a lab that had been capturing monkeys for experimenting on them. Also, according to April, they are planning to send them to someplace from where he can never return to his family.**

**Muffin was scared by this. He wanted to return to his home. He wanted to be free, along with his family.**

**Looking at scared Muffin. April said, she had a plan to escape. But she would need his help in that.**

**Muffin agreed.**

**April showed a key, she said humans gave her this key. So she could enter and exit monkey cage at her will.**

<br>

![DALL·E Illustration : closeup of an ape hand holding keys, digital art](images/DALL%C2%B7E-closeup_of_a_black_monkey_hand_holding_keys_%2C_digital_art.png)
*Prompt: closeup of an ape hand holding keys, digital art*

<br>

**April said, if they try to escape humans could lock every exit door and release a gas that would put everyone to sleep. In fact, they release this sleeping gas every night so that they don't cause any problems.**

**Muffin remembered seeing a human press a bunch of button and later smoke being released in their room.**

**April continued, This gas is controlled from a control station, which is in a different room. Apparently, April tried to enter this room on several occasion. But she was never allowed there.**

**There is an air duct at the top of this room, which connects to every other room. That duct also connects to control room.**

**April was not athletic, she tried to jump and but could not reach the duct. She asked other monkeys as well, but no-one could.**

**She said if someone could reach that air duct, then they should be able to reach that control room and disable everything.**

<br>

![DALL·E Illustration : illustration of an air duct high on wall near ceiling, digital art](images/DALL%C2%B7E-illustration_of_an_air_duct_high_on_a_wall_near_ceiling_%2C_digital_art.png)
*Prompt: illustration of an air duct high on wall near ceiling, digital art*

<br>

**More Coming Soon...**

<br>

Now that I look at it, it's quite a deviation from what I had originally planned. I had planned it as a mini story with a maximum of 10 photos to go with it. But as story progressed, I saw the opportunity and grew it to what it is now.

It's just halfway through and there's more to come. It been almost 2 months since I had started working on it. So a little frustrated me wanted to get half the story out.

I will update this article with the completed story soon.
