After refining, reframing, rearranging, reformatting, re-editing, reorganizing, restructuring my post for the gazillionth time. I thought -

> who really cares?

Person reading them would certainly not think -
- why a box in one of my diagram is slightly crooked,
- ~~why is [opp](/nth-digit-of-an-integer) even a series if only one post was supposed to be released~~ fixed it... it's no more a series,
- ~~why this post does not have a 'undraw.co' cover~~ well none of them have now,
- why is lady in cover image not centered, there is more white space to left,
- or why all these questions are in bullet points instead of just being a paragraph...

Many might not even get what I am speaking of, but hey... stay with me!

Okay, so... I have heard it's always attractive to start your post with some statistics. Here I have one - Average time I usually take to compose a post is around 24 days. 

Yes, 24 freaking days!!!

That's more than half a month of planning, typing, editing, drawing, typing, editing, planning, typing, typing and a lot of typing. That's the kind of grunt work I do to get a single post out!

Well, spending that much time perfecting each post. Some might think that is not bad, it's better than having a really badly written blog.

Listen to me! 24 days is a long time! By the time I get to publishing it, I would have lost all the motive, drive and interest I had when I started writing the blog. 

Heck! I would have read it so many times, that final read would bore me to death. I would give up all hope of someone finding it interesting and almost always feel like not publishing it! 

But this one escaped that hellish grind, I wrote it in a night's time...

On that note, here's something in the celebration of this post getting published. Another statistics - Content you see here is 1/5th of what I plan and start working on.

Well, that's a given - Some ideas are only good when it's in your head. 

But the agony of not being able to see one of your really good idea completed - because it was too grand, or it would take too much time, or it would require you to do a drastic change to your site - is just too much! 

Some of my really great ideas were sacrificed for a more easy to implement ones that I would say is not really... good enough. 

Okay... all said! Why am I even writing this post? Am I finally giving up on writing blogs? 

**Heck No!!!**

In fact, it's the opposite. I have decided on some changes to my posting style and pattern...

- I will stop being so picky about the topics to write on.
- I will stop being so rigid on having a consistent theme across all posts.
- I will stop trying to be perfect till every last word.
- I will stop thinking if people would read it.
- I will stop thinking if people would judge me for something I write.
- I will stop having second parts in my plan, those are scams! Never works!
- I will stop refining my posts and thus reduce my post composition time.

These, I hope will help me get more posts posted consistently!

Consistency... I have fallen in this trap before, that's when I spewed out a really sub-par post, "[Features that Define Python](/features-that-define-python)". 

Not having something ready to post, made me write something which I didn't really believe in. 

Old me would have quickly deleted that post out of existence. But doing that would only make me delete posts further. So, I will keep it. It could still be useful to some, even if that's 1 in 1000.

So, as a final note! to that imaginary person who stumbled upon this (not search engine optimized, not analytics linked, not advertized) blog -

>  Expect more posts from me in future!

Have a Good Day! ‚ù§Ô∏è (~That's one phrase that will definitely not change!)
