This is  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250425113517/https://blog.gauthamchettiar.com/" target="_blank">yet another attempt</a> to create a simpler, faster, elegant looking blog. 

Infact this is my 3rd attempt. My excuse last time was I had decided to move from [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). This time around my excuse is well... <span title="I want to push my long term inactivity & inconsistency under the rug. Also it is an attempt to remove my low quality / low effort posts from last time."> nothing in particular</span>. 

My motto last time - *churn out content baby!*  
My motto this time - *go tiny! how tiny? this article tiny!*

Other actually meaningful changes I have made - 
- clipping blog header title to reflect my motto *(where are all the vowels?)*
- less custom css/html stuff, let me put more effort in content itself *(snort!!!)*
- changed theme *(bear hug anyone?)*

Also <del>I promise that</del> I will make no promises.

Update schedule - none!  
Meaningful quality content always - nahi!  
Meticulous, gramatically correct writing - nada!

This attempt is just me having fun with words!
