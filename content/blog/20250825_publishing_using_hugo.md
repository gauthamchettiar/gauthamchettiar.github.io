A no-nonsense opinionated guide to get your blog published using [hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [github](https://github.com/), [cloudflare pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) and [godaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/).

This publishing workflow is not meant for total beginners, but should be more of a hand-holding guide for someone:   
- who knows how to work with Git and have a github/gitlab account.
- who are comfortable working with terminal commands rather than a GUI. 
- who is comfortable writing blogs in markdown, i.e: if you know how Hugo works and you are okay with it. 
- who can navigate around web to figure out stuff, especially if something goes wrong you should be able to google and fix it. 

If you would rather prefer a more straightforward & less involved way to blog, consider [bear blog](https://bearblog.dev/) instead.

## Step 1 : Setting up Hugo
1. Install Hugo : [Mac](https://gohugo.io/installation/macos) | [Windows](https://gohugo.io/installation/windows/) | [Linux](https://gohugo.io/installation/linux) 
2. Install Git : [Mac](https://git-scm.com/downloads/mac) | [Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win) | [Linux](https://git-scm.com/downloads/linux) 
3. Check if hugo is installed properly by running :  `hugo version`
4. Choose a project folder, usually documents folder works :
    ```bash {lineNos=false}
        # Mac / Linux 
        mkdir ~/Documents/Projects/; cd ~/Documents/Projects/
        # Windows 
        mkdir %USERPROFILE%\Documents\Projects & cd %USERPROFILE%\Documents\Projects
    ```
5. Choose a project name (for a personal blog something like `<your-name>-blog` just works) and run - `hugo new site <your-name>-blog`.
6. A new directory would be created, step into that : 
    ```bash {lineNos=false}
        # Mac / Linux 
        cd ~/Documents/Projects/<your-name>-blog
        #Windows 
        cd %USERPROFILE%\Documents\Projects<your-name>-blog
    ```
7. Initialize git repository : `git init`

**Theming**
1. Choose a theme from - [themes.gohugo.io](https://themes.gohugo.io/) (e.g: this blog uses [hugo-bearblog](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-bearblog/))
2. Go to git repository of that theme using download button - 
    ![hugo download button](/blog/20251106_publishing_using_hugo/hugo_download_button.png)
3. Now there are 2 ways to use this in your blog [[?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61505790/hugo-theme-submodule-marked-as-dirty-doesnt-update)] -  
   1. Simple but sometimes restrictive -  directly add above git project as a submodule :  
   `git submodule add https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog.git`.  
   2. **(recommended)** Slight maintainance overhead but highly customizable -
      - Fork the project :  
     ![git fork button](/blog/20251106_publishing_using_hugo/git_fork_button.png)
      - Add forked project as a submodule :  
      `git submodule add https://github.com/gauthamchettiar/hugo-bearblog.git`
4. Add above theme to hugo.toml -  
`echo "theme = 'hugo-bearblog'" >> hugo.toml`

## Step 2 : Writing your first post
1. Run below command to create a new post *(‚ö†Ô∏è this is dependent on theme implementation, check theme specific [README](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog/blob/master/README.md) first)* -   
`hugo new blog/<post-subject>.md`
2. A new markdown file would be created at - `content/blog/<post-subject>.md`
    ![hugo md file](/blog/20251106_publishing_using_hugo/hugo_md_file.png)
    Again, your file might look slightly different based on theme you choose.
3. Edit this markdown file to include your post content. 
4. Preview your blog locally :   
`hugo server -D`
5. Go to web server link provided in output, usually [http://localhost:1313/](http://localhost:1313/) : 
    ```text {lineNos=false, hl_Lines=6}
        ...
        Built in 72 ms
        Environment: "development"
        Serving pages from disk
        Running in Fast Render Mode. For full rebuilds on change: hugo server --disableFastRender
        Web Server is available at http://localhost:1313/ (bind address 127.0.0.1) 
        Press Ctrl+C to stop
    ```
6. You should be able to preview your web page here. Also, this would be auto-updated every time you make changes to your markdown file and save it :
    ```text {lineNos=false}
        ...
        Change detected, rebuilding site (#36).
        2025-10-06 13:43:53.971 +0100
        Source changed /blog/20251106_publishing_using_hugo.md
        Web Server is available at http://localhost:1313/ (bind address 127.0.0.1)
        Total in 4 ms
    ```

## Step 3 : Pushing to Github
1. Create a [new repository](https://github.com/new) on github.
2. Copy `<github-project-url>` from above created project : e.g https://github.com/gauthamchettiar/gauthamchettiar.github.io
3. Run below set of commands from your hugo blog directory : 
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    git branch -M main
    git remote add origin <github-project-url> # replace with copied URL
    git push -u origin main
    ```

## Step 4 : Publishing using Cloudflare Pages
<!-- > Since this gets updated pretty much all the time, there is no guarantee that this will continue to work in future. For latest instruction check [official docs](). -->

1. Signup for [Cloudflare Pages](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up/workers-and-pages) account, if you have not done it yet.
2. Search for "Workers & Pages", and go to that page : 
    ![Cloudflare - Workers & Pages Seach](/blog/20251106_publishing_using_hugo/cf_workers_and_pages.png)
    As of writing this post, this is at *Compute (Workers) > Workers & Pages*
3. Click on "Create Application" :
    ![Cloudflare - Create Application](/blog/20251106_publishing_using_hugo/cf_create_application.png)
4. Select repository : ![Cloudflare - Deploy 1](/blog/20251106_publishing_using_hugo/cf_hugo_deploy_1.png)
    - Link your github account to cloudflare pages using "Add Account", then 
    - Choose the repository where hugo blog is pushed to, and
    - Click on "Begin Setup".
5. Setup builds and deployments: ![Cloudflare - Deploy 2](/blog/20251106_publishing_using_hugo/cf_hugo_deploy_2.png)
   - Choose a name for your project, this will be deployed as:  
        `https://<project-name>.pages.dev`
   - Choose "Production branch" as "master", then
   - Choose "Framework Preset" as "Hugo", and
   - Click on "Save and Deploy"
6. Your deployment would finish and you would be given a link where your app is deployed : ![Cloudflare - Deploy 3](/blog/20251106_publishing_using_hugo/cf_hugo_deploy_3.png)
7. This is a WWW link that you can immediately start sharing with everyone. 

## Step 5 (Optional) : Setting up custom domain
While this is not required, it's nice to have a permanent address on internet.

1. **HARDEST PART** come up with a good domain name for your blog, *I choose to keep my actual name as domain*.
2. Buy a domain on [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/en-uk), or any website where you find [registration and renewal options to be cheapest](https://tld-list.com/).
3. Go back to cloudflare "Workers & Pages" > "Custom Domain" > "Set up a custom domain" : ![Cloudflare - Custom Domain 1](/blog/20251106_publishing_using_hugo/cf_custom_domain.png)
4. Add a domain, it could include a subdomain (*blog.yourdomain.com*) if you wish:  ![Cloudflare - Custom Domain 2](/blog/20251106_publishing_using_hugo/cf_custom_domain_2.png)
5. Once you click on "Activate domain" it would add your record to it's DNS. 
6. In order for cloudflare to manage DNS records, you need to [add nameservers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/setup/#update-your-nameservers) displayed in cloudflare to GoDaddy : ![GoDaddy Nameserver Setup](/blog/20251106_publishing_using_hugo/godaddy_nameserver_setup.png)
7. It could take upto 24 hours for entire thing to be up and running!  

Aaaaand, That's it!
