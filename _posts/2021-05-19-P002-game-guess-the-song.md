<p style='color:grey'>Disclaimer: I am always against using copyrighted images, but this project would have been incomplete without those. Feel free to ask me to take any image down or provide credit against any, I would be more than happy to oblige. This is more like a hobby project and won't and shouldn't be used for any commercial purpose.</p>

I am 90s Kid, So Naturally, I grew up listening to Bollywood (place I grew up in) and and Kollywood (place I belong to) songs. A.R Rahman was a hearththrob those days, actually... he still is. He strung a chord in my heart, his music moved me beyond words. I feel, 90s as a whole was a golden era, with treasure trove of songs, that can never be re-imagined and never should be re-mixed. 

Now getting to the bit on which I decided to dedicate an entire blog post to - I came up with a game, whose difficulty simply depends on your obsession with 90s songs. It's not an original concept, but nonetheless I did spend significant time finding images that would be relevant and be funny to guess. So here we go, let me introduce you to the game -

You will be provided with a series of images that represent lyrics of some song from 90s Bollywood. You have to make sure you somehow try to co-relate images with a song and guess it! 

## Example
Below Example would actually make it clear,
![](/assets/img/P002/guess_the_song_example.png)
<span style='margin-top:5px;color:#FF4500;'>Song : Tip Tip Barsa Paani</span><br>
<span style='margin-top:5px;color:#FF4500;'>How? : Tip (there's tip on what looks like a restaurant table) - Tip - Bar - Saw - Paa (Amitabh's character from movie Paa) - Knee</span>

## Game Begins
Hope that example would have given you a taste of the game, now let me dump everything I got -
