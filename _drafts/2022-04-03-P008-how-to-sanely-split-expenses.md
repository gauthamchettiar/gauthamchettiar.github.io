After hours and hours of discussion and months of planning - that goa trip is finally happening. You with your group of 5 closest friends have finally boarded the train to Madgaon! 

You all begin to settle down and immediately your tummy raises a bell, it seems your friends too share a similar experience and you unanimously decide to buy Samosa's for all. It's Rs. 20 each and you really don't care at this point, as the trip has just started.

Soon the situation seems to be slightly out of hand when you seem to have paid for most of the minor expenses, but you have confidence over your memory. You constantly check the remaining amount in your wallet, to remember what expenses were made.

It's been 4 days, everyone has paid for something which only they rememeber. You on the other hand had been struggling to keep tab on the expenses you had made.

So, You finally decide to make a note of expenses, on your notes app. And soon you start to see the problem - all expenses were not made for everyone one in the group. What about those who didn't have alcohol, you had decided to not include them in that payment. Also at times when you were short of certain amount, someone had pitched in the shortage, so you essentually made a payment in co with some other person. 

Now you regret not making note of every expense then and there. Also hope that somehow, at the end of trip, everyone will leave home with an equal contribution.

While it's easy to say, just keeping note of all expenses will solve everything. At times, it's not really possible. There are some fundamental issues in this approach like - Who will make the note?  Where will be the note be made? What if the place where you had been keeping note is lost during trip? What If multiple people have been keeping a note and there had been some discrepancies?


## Different Types of Splits
### Who Paid?
Person who is paying for an expense is essentially lending money to others who is part of that expense, that means others owe money to the person who paid. Depending on this factor, split can fall under one of several below categories -

#### All Equally Contributed
![All Equally Contributed](/assets/img/P008/01.png)
This is the most easiest type of split to calculate, as there is nothing to split. Everyone has equally contributed for the expense and thus no one owes anyone. This is mostly done when the contribution amount is substantially huge, like an entry ticket to an event/concert/experience/ride. In such cases, unless there is a single person with enough finances, every person pays with their own money.

#### One Person Paid All
![One Person Paid All](/assets/img/P008/02.png)
Most of the expenses are of this type. Now, let's say, everyone has had lunch at a restaurant and you have paid the bill. Since everyone had lunch, everyone owes you. This is also the most easiest to track and thus the most ideal type of split. Groups should try to make this type of payment whenever possible.

#### Few Person Equally Contributed
![Few Person Equally Contributed](/assets/img/P008/03.png)
While one person pays all seems to be a good model, it's not ideally possible. Let's say a group of 6 have decided to take a cab somewhere, since its not possible to fit 6 people in a 4 person cab you decide to tke 2 cabs. The person who was designated to pay all the expenses, now cannot pay for both the cabs, thus there has to be someone else paying for one of it. While this is slightly annoying to calculate later on, it is still a relatively easier split.

#### All/Some Unequally Contributed
![All/Some Unequally Contributed](/assets/img/P008/04.png)
Sometimes amount may be slightly larger plus some small change. Let's say if the amount per person is Rs. 1099, and everyone has Rs. 1000 change readily available and have decided to contribute so. Rs. 99 x 5 Person extra was contributed by you, and thus everyone owes only that much to you. You have paid slightly larger than everyone else (you have made an unequal contribution), and thus this must be recorded as so. 

It is still easy when unequal split was made by single person, but it will get complicated when multiple person, have made different amount of payment for a single transaction. Try to avoid this whenever possible.

### Paid For Whom?
Similar to participant who Paid. Expense also includes participants who are part of expense and thus owe the participant who paid.

#### Paid for All, Equal Contribution
![Paid for All, Equal Contribution](/assets/img/P008/02.png)

Every participant in a group has been a part of contribution where payment might have been done by a single or multiple participant. Most of the expenses would be of this type. 

#### Paid for Some, Equal contribution
![Paid for Some, Equal contribution](/assets/img/P008/05.png)

This is again quite a common occurence, when some Individual does not participate in a certain activity and thus they must be excluded from the contribution towards it.

#### Paid for All/Some, Different Contributions
![Paid for All/Some, Different Contributions](/assets/img/P008/06.png)

These kind of contributions usually happen when a certain or group of individuals partially participate in some activity. Let's say there is a group of people who do not consume alcohol, it won't be fair to include them in contributions towards the entire bill, as alcohol would be a major chunk of bill, and those participants would have simply been at a loss.

## Where to Record Expenses?
### Record on Paper

### Record on Any Notes App

### Record using Photos

### Record using Excel

### Record using App (Specialized for this)

## Who Should Note and Calculate Splits?
Taking note of expenses is a tedious and recurring task. I have seen people who really enjoy noting down and calculating expenses and splits. I have also seen people who absolutely despise the same. And more often than not, people who like to do this kind of stuff are those who like to remain organized. 

Have someone who have done something similar before? Have someone who even slightly organizes stuff? They should be the one noting down the expenses and splits. Also he/she should be a person who the group can trust.

At times I have seen people assign a second person as a fallback in case first person forgets to note something down, but this actually does more harm than good. It could happen that both may think the other person would take care of it and not note it down. So having only one person doing all the hardwork is the most reliable way.

In case the group strength is not manageable e.g: greater than 12. Then it's better to divide the group into 2 and have 2 different people take care of expenses only for their subgroup. 

## Practical Techniques to Record and Split Bills
### 1. Make It Easier

### 2. Recording Expenses
Expenses can be recorded on any medium mentioned in previous section. But, essentially there are 3 ways to record - Text or Writing, Excel or Database, or Specialized App.

While recording directly in a Specialized App or Excel is best for both calculation and tracking, it is not always possible. Thus most of the times you end up taking up a note in your notepad or your notes app. 

I have devised a noting system that minimises keystrokes (for quick entry) while covering all scenarios that one might face while recording expenses for split. 

Here's a sample on how you may record the same - 

```
# 2022-03-22
Evening Snack = AB 120 / 
Cab, Station to Hotel = AB 540, PQ 540 / 
Dinner = AB 3400 / 1200, IJ, MN / 2200, AB, PQ, XY
Summer Fest = 5000 /
Summer Fest = AB 2000 /
```

It may all look gibberish to unknown. But as you understand the model, it will turn into a convenient way to record all kinds of expenses and splits. 

Here's a quick look of the system,
![Text Recording - Quick Look](/assets/img/P008/11.png)

It might still not be clear, so I will list different ways notation can be used for different scenarios. Consider there are following participants - `AB`, `IJ`, `MN`, `PQ`, `XY`.

#### Notations for different splits

1. **One Pays, Paid For All (Equal Contribution)**

   `AB` paid *200* for `ALL`.
   > ... = AB 200 /
   
2. **One Pays, Paid For Some (Equal Contribution)**

   `AB` paid *200* for himself, `PQ` and `XY` only.
   > ... = AB 200 / AB, PQ, XY
   
   `AB` paid *200* for `ALL` except `XY`.
   > ... = AB 200 / -XY

3. **One Pays, Paid For All/Some (Unequal Contribution)**
   
   `AB` paid *200*, where `PQ` and `XY` has to pay *50* and `AB`, `MN` has to pay *150*.
   > ... = AB 200 / 50, PQ, XY / 150, AB, MN

   `AB` paid *200*, `PQ` has to pay *50*, `AB` and `MN` need to equally share the remaining amount.
	> ... = AB 200 / 50, PQ / AB, MN

	`AB` paid *200*, `PQ` has to pay *50*, and rest needs to equally share the remaining amount.
	> ... = AB 200 / 50, PQ /

4. **Multiple Pays, Paid For All (Equal Contribution)**

   `AB` paid *100* and `PQ` paid *100* for `ALL`
   >  ... = AB 100, PQ 100 /

5. **Multiple Pays, Paid For Some (Equal Contribution)**

   `AB` paid *100* and `PQ` paid *100* for themselves and`MN` only.
   > ... = AB 100, PQ 100 / AB, PQ, MN
   
   `AB` paid *200* and `PQ` paid *100* for `ALL` except `XY`.
   > ... = AB 100, PQ 100 / -XY

6. **Multiple Pays, Paid For All/Some (Unequal Contribution)**

   `AB` paid *100* and `PQ` paid *100*, where `PQ` and `XY` has to pay *50* and `AB`, `MN` has to pay *150*.
   > ... = AB 100, PQ 100 / 50, PQ, XY / 150, AB, MN

   `AB` paid *100* and `PQ` paid *100*, `PQ` has to pay *50*, `AB` and `MN` need to equally share the remaining amount.
	> ... = AB 100, PQ 100 / 50, PQ / AB, MN

	`AB` paid *100* and `PQ` paid *100*, `PQ` has to pay *50*, and rest needs to equally share the remaining amount.
	> ... = AB 100, PQ 100 / 50, PQ /

7. **Everyone Paid Equal Amount**
   
   `ALL` Paid 100
   > ... = 100 /

8. **Multiline Records**

   It's not required to record an expense in a single line, it can be split across multiple lines as well -
   > Summer Fest = 5000 /  
   > Summer Fest = AB 2000 /


The format given above is not set in stone, one may change it as per your requirement and convenience.
