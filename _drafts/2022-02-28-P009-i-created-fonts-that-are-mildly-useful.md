FONTS ARE A STATEMENT! 

Fonts define the tone of your content - using an inappropriate font can make it difficult for readers to understand what you are trying to convey. Companies create their own font, to stick out from the crowd. Some Institutes and Organizations enforce certain fonts for all their communication. That's how important fonts a.k.a typefaces are! 

Choosing your font equals choosing your readers. You cannot have a very sophisticated study written in [Comic Sans](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-11582548){:target="_blank"}! 

In a way, a person can be profiled using their choice of font. My favorite font is [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto){:target="_blank"}! Probably because; I am an Android power user and seeing that font as a default on my phone, got my eyes used to it!

While there are tons of usable fonts, there's an equally large number of decorative fonts. These fonts are totally bonkers and may cater to very niche usecases...

As a kid, when I was first introduced to computer, one of my most favorite passtime would be MS Paint! The second thing that I was fascinated by was [Wingdings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webdings)! How could I not be, writing a capital "J" gave me a Smiley! 

*This is what pre-emoji / pre-smartphone era was like!*

Even now, My fascination with fonts haven't changed. Today, I have decided to create 5 fonts that is both useful and useless at the same time. No these aren't decorative fonts like Creepster or Ransom Note. But, these are variations on my ever favorite "*Roboto*" and an all time classic "*Courier*". 

These fonts try to solve solve problems that never existed in the first place!

So here we go,

# BAMADA    
No, that's not a mis-spell but the name of font. Sometimes you feel like writing something down, but also fear that someone might read it, so this font is for you! Write illegible sentences, that only make sense to you (and couple others who read this blog).

# Pl\*\*s\* D\*n't Sw\*\*r
Swearing is bad! Especially when you are writing a letter to your manager. Fear not! use this Font that will mask all swear letters and create a safe to read letter!

# Oh My Neck!
Common problem that plagues every programer is neck pain! this font here is to solve that problem. It is oriented in a way that maximises neck movements and minimizes health risks! Thank me Later!

# Low Ink?
Courier is the Font you are looking for if you want to minimize the use of ink. But Why not take it a step further? This font is just readable enough to make sense, but at the same saves a ton on ink! 

# Everything is Hangman!
Ever liked hangman so much that you wanted to play it everywhere? This Font has half the letters as underscores, making every word feel like you are playing a game of hangman!
