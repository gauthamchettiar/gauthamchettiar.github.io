Python has topped as one of the most sought-after programming language in recent times. Mostly due to its simplicity and a feature-set that makes coding a breeze. This has in turn lead to several tutorials for pythons focusing more on beginner-level topics, but when you look for places to get out of that initial shell, the material is scarce. I am writing this article to act as a bridge in such a case.

This article focuses on Lists, Dictionaries, and Functions. You can use below [Index](#index) as a reference and skip to topics that are relevant to you. Each item is complete in itself and does not require reading any of the prior items, unless explicitly mentioned.

Each list item is divided into 3 sections,
- Usecase
- Code Example 
- More Reference Material 

# Index
1. [List \| enumerate(), zip() and itertools.ziplongest() Functions](#list--enumerate-zip-and-itertoolsziplongest-functions)
2. [Dict \| items(), keys() and values() Functions](#dict--items-keys-and-values-functions)
3. [Functions \| Positional and Named Arguments](#functions--positional-and-named-arguments)
4. [Functions \| Variable Positional and Named Arguments](#functions--variable-positional-and-named-arguments)
5.  [Functions \| Decorators](#functions--decorators)
